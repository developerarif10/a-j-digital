    solutions_heading: 'Navigating Technical Complexity',
    solutions: "We leveraged Shopify's Storefront API to build a fully headless architecture using Next.js. This allowed us to create rich, magazine-style layouts that traditional e-commerce themes couldn't support. We implemented a persistent cart and a streamlined one-page checkout to ensure that despite the immersive storytelling, the path to purchase remained friction-free."
